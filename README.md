# OnNER
The __Ontology for Named Entity Representation (OnNER)__ models named entities  as they appear in scientific publications and what is necessary to locate them therein. It is intended to be used to capture each publication and all its named entities -- as extracted by various NER tools -- as an RDF document. These documents can be easily queried together for their named entities.
